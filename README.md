## 📌 Project Title

Amazon Product Sales & Performance Dashboard

## 📝 Summary

An Excel-based dashboard analyzing sales, discounts, promotions, and inventory performance of Amazon products.

## 🔎 Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing product sales performance on Amazon** using multiple datasets.
It highlights how discounts, promotions, and stock levels affect revenue, helping to identify profitable products, restocking needs, and anomalies in sales patterns.

## ❓ Problem Statement

E-commerce companies like Amazon handle **millions of transactions daily**. Raw reports are overwhelming, and without structured analysis, businesses struggle to answer:

* How much revenue is lost due to discounts?
* Which products need urgent restocking?
* What anomalies exist in pricing and sales trends?
* Which promotions actually drive performance?

This dashboard solves those challenges using Excel analytics.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Tables Used**:

  * `march_2021` – Monthly sales & discounts data
  * `may_2022` – Updated product sales & promotions
  * `sale report` – Consolidated sales records
  * `amazon sale report` – Platform-wide sales & returns data
* **Columns**:

  * `product_id`, `product_name`
  * `sale_date`, `units_sold`, `revenue`
  * `discount`, `promotion_applied`
  * `stock_level`

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation
* **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts** – For aggregations
* **Power Query** – Data transformation
* **Conditional Formatting** – Highlighting anomalies
* **Excel Formulas (SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, IF, etc.)** – Business logic

## ⚙️ Methods

* Data cleaning (removing negative quantities & unit prices)
* Calculated fields for:

  * Revenue lost due to discounts
  * Promotion-driven sales uplift
  * Inventory vs. sales analysis
* Interactive dashboard using slicers, charts, and KPIs
